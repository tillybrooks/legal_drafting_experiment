              <p>The Secretary may also contract for inspections or examinations in the United States and in foreign countries. The primary reason for including a provision that permits the contracting for the conduct of inspections and examinations is to provide flexibility in foreign areas where Coast Guard marine inspectors are not normally available. A contract inspector may be authorized to act on behalf of the Secretary, but may not issue a certificate of inspection or compliance.</p>
